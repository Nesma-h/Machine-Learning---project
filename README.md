# Student Performance Prediction

A machine learning project designed to predict student academic performance using supervised learning models. This project implements predictive systems for two critical tasks: classifying pass/fail status and predicting final grades.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to provide insights into student performance. By analyzing various academic indicators, the system can:

1. **Predict Pass/Fail Status**: Binary classification to determine if a student will pass or fail
2. **Predict Final Grade**: Regression model to estimate the student's final grade

### Key Features
- Multiple model evaluation (classification and regression)
- Optimized SVM models for both prediction tasks
- Interactive web interface via Streamlit
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization

## 🎯 Objectives

### Task 1: Pass/Fail Classification
- **Goal**: Binary classification to predict whether a student will pass or fail
- **Models Evaluated**: 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree (DT)
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) ✅ **Selected**
- **Result**: SVM achieved the best performance and was selected as the final model

### Task 2: Final Grade Prediction
- **Goal**: Regression model to predict the student's final grade
